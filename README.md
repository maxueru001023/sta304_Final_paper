- 'outputs' also contains the files necessary to reproduce the paper. We have the pdf copy of the paper on 'Analysis of General Social Survey 2021 with a focus on resident's time spent online' as well as the rmd file in order to reproduce it and a reference bib file containing the references used for the paper.


## Obtaining data

  - We applied the survey conducted in the year of 2021.
  
  
## Preprocessing and Cleaning

After obtaining the 'raw data', some cleaning was done. 

Geographics and other aspects such as mental health are used to predict time spent online. we identified that respondents with lower age, weaker education level and poorer quality of life evaluations exhibited a greater tendency to spend more time online.Our analysis provides a guideline for future regulations of the Internet access time of residents."
